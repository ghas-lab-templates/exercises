## Enablement Settings 

**TO DO: FINISH THIS AFTER DEC 10 WHEN ENTERPRISE CONFIGS HAVE SHIPPED**

GitHub security configurations provide a way to manage and enforce security settings across repositories in your organization, enabling consistent 
application of security best practices. Organizations can choose from two options based on their needs:
- GitHub-recommended security configurations
- custom security configurations.

### Lab - Setting Up a Custom Security Configuration

(Instructor notes: Mention how we recommend securing your organization with the GitHub-recommended security configuration, then evaluating the security findings on your repositories
before configuring custom security configurations. However, for learning experience we will set up our own security configuration. )

In this lab, you will learn how to create and apply a custom security configuration to repositories in your organization. Follow the steps below to complete the exercise:

1. Click on your Organisation's settings
